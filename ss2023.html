					<img src = "img\ss\optic.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
					<h3>Optical Illusions</h3>
					<p>In what was an ingenious display of creativity,
					fashion played with <b>optical illusions</b>,<br>
					unveiling <i>trompe l'oeil</i> pieces that transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary.<br>
					With pixelated shapes, trouser skirts and faux topless effects,<br>
					the body was celebrated with futuristic accents at the <i>Y/Project</i>, <i>Loewe</i> and <i>Balmain</i> shows.
				</div>
				<div class = "two">
					<img src = "img\ss\cargo.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
					<h3>Cargo</h3>
					<p>From their origins in the <i>British army in the late 1930s to today</i>, <b>cargo pants</b> have not aged a bit.<br>
					At the crossroads between military aesthetics and streetwear influences,<br>
					they became a fashion essential at <i>Coperni</i>, <i>Diesel</i> and <i>Fendi</i>.
				</div>
				<div class = "three">
					<img src = "img\ss\crochet.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
					<h3>Cute Crochet</h3>
					<p>Blending <i>craftsmanship and 1970s charm</i>, <b>crochet</b> remains a failsafe option for summer.<br>
					Fitting in with city and beachy wardrobes alike,<br>
					it came in a natural color palette at <i>Hermès</i>, <i>Isabel Marant</i> and <i>Marine Serre</i>.
				</div>

			<div class = "right">
				<div class = "four">
					<img src = "img\ss\sunset.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
					<h3>Shades of Sunset</h3>
					<p>What would summer be without its sunsets?<br>
					This season, as well as thriving on Instagram,
					they will also prevail in our wardrobes.<br>
					The sunset effect with <i>flamboyant dip-dye shading</i> came on <i>close-to-the-body silhouettes</i><br>
					by <i>Etro</i>, <i>Ferragamo</i>, and <i>Courrèges</i>.<br>
					This trend will last from the high season right up until the Indian summer. 
				</div>
				<div class = "five">
					<img src = "img\ss\flower.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
					<h3>3D Flowers</h3>
					<p>Whether with a new twist on a bouquet or with lifelike tropical flowers,<br>
					<i>Off-White</i> (Ibrahim Kamara's debut collection), <i>Loewe</i> (with its giant anthurium) and
					<br><i>Bottega Veneta</i>transformed simple garments into blossoming works of art.</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "six">
					<img src = "img\ss\chic.jpg" width = "auto" height = "400">
					<h3>Chic Transparency</h3>
					<p>This monomania comes with a side of <i>perfectly calibrated transparency</i><br> to create a silhouette that is sexier than ever.<br>
					The must-have black dresses of the season hinted at glimpses of the body<br>
					at <i>Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello</i>, <i>Valentino</i> and <i>Ami</i>.</p>
